Millions of people everyday begin to think about planning and looking up possible places to take a trip.
Those Ideas of a possible places to share an experience are important to be able to keep track of. This

They can then pick dates to leave and return from their trip. Next they can go to the top of the page and search in our Open AI the name of the Destination and things to do at that Destination.
